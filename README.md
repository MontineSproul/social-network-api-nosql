# Social Network API

## Description 
When a command is entered the application is invoked then the server is started and Mongoose models are synced to the database. In insomnia when I open the API routes the data is displayed in JSON. For users and thoughts you are able to successfully CREATE, READ, UPDATE AND DELETE in the database.
